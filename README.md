# DevOps Lifecycle Overview

# üõ†Ô∏è What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices that bridges the gap between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). Its goal is to shorten the system development life cycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently and reliably. DevOps promotes a culture of collaboration, automation, continuous integration, and rapid feedback.

# üîë Core Principles of DevOps

- Collaboration: Encouraging communication between dev and ops teams.
- Automation: Streamlining repetitive tasks to increase efficiency.
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Ensuring code changes are automatically tested and deployed.
- Monitoring and Feedback: Enabling quick identification and resolution of issues.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Managing infrastructure with code and automation tools.

# üîÑ DevOps Lifecycle Stages

1. Planning: Define requirements, scope, and project roadmap using tools like Jira or Trello.
2. Development: Write and commit code using version control systems such as Git.
3. Building: Compile source code into executable files using CI tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions).
4. Testing: Automatically run unit, integration, and performance tests to ensure code quality.
5. Release: Approve and tag stable versions for production through automated pipelines.
6. Deployment: Deliver applications to production environments using containerization or orchestration tools like Docker and Kubernetes.
7. Operations: Manage infrastructure and ensure systems are scalable and reliable.
8. Monitoring: Track performance and log errors using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK Stack for proactive issue detection.
